      <p><strong>Variables:</strong> Variable means anything that can vary. In JavaScript, a variable stores the data value that can be changed later on. ... The default value of variables that do not have any value is undefined. You can assign a value to a variable using the = operator when you declare it or after the declaration and before accessing it.</p>
      <p><strong>Variables naming conventions:</strong> Names are <em>case-sensitive</em>, <u>lowercase</u> and <u>uppercase</u> are different. Start variable names with a letter, use <em>camelCase</em> for names. Variable names should be self-descriptive, describing the stored value. Boolean variables are usually prefixed with is or has. <span class="clickable3">Click here</span> to hide.</p>
